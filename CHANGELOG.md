## Unreleased

### Roles: model and effort per lane (#375)

- Every lane is a **Manager** (orchestration `-p*`: PLAN, PRD, DECOMPOSE, REVIEW/gauntlet; bug triage;
  the injector) or an **Implementer** (issue lanes `-i*`, incl. `resume.md`; bug fixes), and launches
  with its role's model and effort: `HARNESS_MODEL_MANAGER`, `HARNESS_EFFORT_MANAGER`,
  `HARNESS_MODEL_IMPLEMENTER`, `HARNESS_EFFORT_IMPLEMENTER`.
- Defaults on `claude`: `opus`/`high` (Manager), `sonnet`/`high` (Implementer). Every other CLI: empty =
  the CLI's own default unless configured.
- Precedence: a worktree hook's `.harness-lane` > the role keys > a `--model`/`--effort` in
  `HARNESS_*_FLAGS`. `harness init` asks for and shows both roles.
- **Behaviour change:** a fleet pinning `--model opus` in `HARNESS_CLAUDE_FLAGS` (harness-dev, ORGE,
  bangwa) gets Sonnet implementers after this. Set `HARNESS_MODEL_IMPLEMENTER=opus` in
  `.harness/config` to keep the old behaviour.
